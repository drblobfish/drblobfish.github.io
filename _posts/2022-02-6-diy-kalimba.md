In late October we decided with my class to do a secret Santa event. It was decided that DIY gifts were strongly encouraged, which imho was a really great idea. After randomly assigning a secret Santa to everyone, I discovered that I had to make a gift for a good friend of mine that happen to be a big music fan. I immediately thought about building some sort of instrument. In addition, this friend is quite interested in microtonal music, which meant I had to build an instrument he could easily tune (or detune) at his will.


Thatâ€™s why I chose to build a **Kalimba** and just for fun, I added the possibility to amplify its signal.

You'll find tha build instrution on [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Electro-Acoustic-Kalimba/)


You'll find the lasercut CAD files on my github, just [here](https://github.com/drblobfish/diy-kalimba/blob/eeba8935dffa867b3b1782de2c6efe5e4560c4bb/lasercut-files/box_to_print.svg).

And here are some pictures of the result :
