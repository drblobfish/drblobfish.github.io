üëã Hi, I‚Äôm **@drblobfish**

---------------------------

I‚Äôm interested in :
- Computational biology üíª
- Opensource health devices ‚öïÔ∏è
- Evolutionnary biology üß¨
- Learning as many things as possible üìñ


üéì I‚Äôm currently an undergrad :
- in 3rd year of the "Frontiers of Life" Science Bachelor at [CRI](https://cri-paris.org/en), [Paris Cit√© University](https://u-paris.fr/en/).
- in 2nd year of the Maths/CS double cursus at [Paris Cit√© University](https://math-info.u-paris.fr/) (at the "Saint Germain" campus, aka "Paris Descartes")

If I got enough time some of my projects will be documented on this website.

------------------

I'm currently learning :
- **[toki pona](https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/)** : a minimalist constructed language. *mi sona e toki pona*
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)** : the programming language, not iron oxide.

Last books I read :
- **[House of leaves](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL16503921W/Mark_Z._Danielewski%27s_House_of_leaves?edition=ia%3Aisbn_9780375703768)** (Currently reading)
- **[Mort](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL453658W/Mort)**, by Terry Pratchett.
- **[Does God play dice](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5838129W/Does_God_Play_Dice)** : Nice classic book about dynamical systems. I borrowed it from someone so didn't finish it.
- **[Oceanic](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17941738W/Oc%C3%A9anique)** : Another collection of SF shorts written by Greg Egan. A must read for every science nerd imho.

Please note :

- **I'm not a doctor**, in fact I chose the nickname DrBlobfish before being even aware of the existence of all those academic honorary title shenanigans
- I don't use social networks like twitter or whatever. But if you want to be notified the next time there's something new on this website, feel free to **use the RSS feed** by clicking the icon below. If you don't know what RSS is, I strongly encourage you to read [this article](https://blog.ncase.me/posts/back-to-the-future-with-rss/) by the one and only Nicky Case.
