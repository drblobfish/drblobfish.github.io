👋 Hi, I’m **@drblobfish**

---------------------------

- I’m interested in :
  - Quantitative biology 💻
  - Opensource health device ⚕️
  - Evolutionnary biology 🧬
  - Learning as much things as possible 📖
- 🎓 I’m currently an undergrad in the "Frontiers of Life" Science Bachelor at [CRI](https://cri-paris.org/en), Paris
- If i got the time some of my projects will be uploaded on this page


----------
Please note :

- **I'm not a doctor**, in fact I chose the nickname DrBlobfish before being even aware of the existence of all those academic honorary title shenanigans
- I don't use social networks like twitter, linked in or whatever. But if you want to be notified the next time there's something new on this website, feel free to **use the RSS feed** by clicking the icon below. If you don't know what RSS is, I strongly encourage you to read [this article](https://blog.ncase.me/posts/back-to-the-future-with-rss/) by the one and only Nicky Case.
