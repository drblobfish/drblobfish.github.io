👋 Hi, I’m **@drblobfish**

---------------------------

I’m interested in :
- Computational biology 💻
- Opensource health devices ⚕️
- Evolutionnary biology 🧬
- Learning as much things as possible 📖


🎓 I’m currently an undergrad in the "Frontiers of Life" Science Bachelor at [CRI](https://cri-paris.org/en), [Paris Cité University](https://u-paris.fr/en/).


If i got the time some of my projects will be uploaded on this website.

------------------

I'm currently learning :
- **[toki pona](https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/)** : a minimalist constructed language. *mi sona e toki pona*
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)** : the programming language, not iron oxide.

Last book I read :
- **[Oceanic](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17941738W/Oc%C3%A9anique)** : Another collection of SF shorts written by Greg Egan. A must read for every science nerd imho.

----------
Please note :

- **I'm not a doctor**, in fact I chose the nickname DrBlobfish before being even aware of the existence of all those academic honorary title shenanigans
- I don't use social networks like twitter or whatever. But if you want to be notified the next time there's something new on this website, feel free to **use the RSS feed** by clicking the icon below.
