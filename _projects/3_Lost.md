LOST is a short game I made with my friend [`<Discursif/>`](https://discursif.itch.io/) for the [*Two Color Game Jam*](https://itch.io/jam/2-colors-game-jam/entries).

I mostly worked on the graphical part of the game, working with Adobe Illustrator and animating with Adobe After Effect

You can download the game on its [itch.io page](https://discursif.itch.io/l0st)
