Little Shadow is a short game I made with a [friend](https://theflo.itch.io/) for the [*All Feather Game Jam*](https://itch.io/jam/allfeathersjam/entries).

I mostly worked on the graphical part of the game.

3d modelling was made with blender
we used the unreal engine as game engine

You can download the game on its [itch.io page](https://theflo.itch.io/little-shadow)
