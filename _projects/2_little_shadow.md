Little Shadow is a short game I made with a [friend](https://theflo.itch.io/) for the [*All Feather Game Jam*](https://itch.io/jam/allfeathersjam/entries).

I mostly worked on the graphical part of the game.

3d modelling was made with blender
we used the unreal engine as game engine

You can download the game on its [itch.io page](https://theflo.itch.io/little-shadow)

The theme of the game jam was **Light and Darkness**.


Here is some early concept art of when we were still figuring out what direction to take.

We eventually decided to stick to the idea of a character using some sort of "shadow light" in a really bright environment.

Here's some of my 3d modelling work.
